# Solar Flare Forecasting

Modeling full-disk solar magnetic field features and forecasting solar flares using deep convolutional neural networks.

## Work

Four deep convolutional neural network architectures—AlexNet, VGGNet, Inception, and ResNet—were constructed based on full-disk solar magnetograms to enable solar flare forecasting.

## Results

The models were evaluated using flare activity data from 2020 to 2024. The evaluation metrics are summarized below:
